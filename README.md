# List the things you added for points
I included a major choice, as well as reflected that back to the player, and included at least one loop.

[+2] I added 8+ passages(around 40)

[+1] I added that the player can pick up keys and knives. If they do not have the right number of keys, it tells them they don't have the right number and need to find them somewhere.

[+1] I gave the player a bravery statistic and their weapons statistics. They can upgrade their bravery or weapons when they get to the concession stand.

[+1] When you pick up a key, the description of the key from the passage goes away once you pick it up. It also gets rid of the locked door description if you have already opened the door.
